Hello, I'm 641i130 aka Caret. I'm currenty an embedded systems engineer learning how firmware is developed using Yocto and Bitbake!
Current interests:
- Breaking and Securing systems (usually *NIX based)
  - Rust
  - Private server development
  - NixOS (coming from Arch Linux)
  - Low Level Development
- Web Scraping / 'Network Abuse'
- 日本語
  - Almost N4

I plan to migrate this to a self hosted forgejo instance at some point. So I guess, make sure to bookmark https://git.caret.rs/
